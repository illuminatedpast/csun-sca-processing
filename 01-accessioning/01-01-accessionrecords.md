## Accessioning Archival Collections
Upon arrival in Special Collections and Archives, all donations are accessioned into our existing holdings. We use [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/5794020/buckets/37360962/card_tables/7354748593) (internal link) to track the progression of a collection through the accessioning process. A high-level accessioning workflow overview is located on [Box here](https://mycsun.box.com/s/o6dkzyb6u0ce3e8ae9n2x5injecd2djb) (internal link). Instructions on how to handle digital materials in accessions are located in this guide [at this link](https://illuminatedpast.github.io/csun-sca-processing/02-processing/02-05-digitalprocessing.html).

After completing appraisal, the archivist who accepts physical custody of the accession is responsible for having the Deed of Gift or Records Transfer Authorization form(s) signed and in hand. We cannot physically accept materials until ownership or custody has been transferred through these documents. Original deeds of gift are sent to Library Development, and photocopies are filed in the collection's case file. Original Records Transfer Authorization forms are filed in the record group's case file.

Unless they have already been checked for issues, new donations are accessioned in the Special Collections and Archives workroom to prevent potential exposure of our existing holdings to mold, pests, or other conservation problems.

---

- All incoming materials are carefully inspected for insects, mold, and other potential preservation problems. 
  - Gloves and masks may be required during this inspection. 
  - Obvious conservation concerns (bugs, mold, etc.) should be immediately addressed, but other less immediate conservation concerns (newsprint, photographs, rusted fasteners, etc.) can be left until full processing takes place. 
  - If necessary, a new accession can be "quarantined," or the area surrounding its final shelf location can be monitored by staff.

- New accessions should generally be reboxed or otherwise re-housed.  Cardboard boxes from unknown storage spaces at a donor's home or place of employment pose conservation risks which should not be introduced to our storage areas. Furthermore, our boxes fit on our shelves, thereby maximizing the quantity of materials we are able to fit into our storage spaces. Use temporary (not permanent) acid-free containers, such as record center boxes, to rehouse accessions.
  - In most cases, re-housing should be managed by an archivist.  Materials should not be placed in storage areas without proper housing (or without housing of any kind).
  - Materials should be re-foldered on an as-needed basis only, and only to address immediate preservation concerns.
  - It is extremely important that the original order of the collection is maintained as much as possible during this process.

- The accessioning archivist creates a collection Basecamp card if one does not already exist (see card template on Basecamp board).

- The accessioning archivist creates an Accession record on ASpace that includes:
  - A unique accession number comprised of four digits to represent the year and the number that donation is for the year. Example: The first donation of 2023 would be assigned 2023-001. For old unaccessioned materials with unknown donation years, XXXX is used to represent the year, with the next sequentially available XXXX donation number appended. Refer to ArchivesSpace to determine the next available donation number.
  - A unique collection code. These are generally 3 letter codes with the letters pulled from the Collection Titles. In order to ensure these are unique, when assigning a new Collection Code the archivist needs to:
    - Search ArchivesSpace to make sure the Collection Code wasn't already assigned to an unprocessed collection.
    - Do an advanced search in the library catalog, searching the "Call Number" field for the Collection Code you'd like to assign to make sure that it wasn't assigned to an already processed collection.
  - The temporary or draft name of the collection. 
  - The name of the donor or office of transfer.
  - The arrival date of the collection (from the Deed of Gift).
  - A brief abstract about the accession’s creator
  - A brief preliminary inventory of the accession’s contents. The level of inventory detail is at the accessioner's discretion. If box-level description is sufficient there's no need to inventory at the folder level. When donors provide inventories, they can be referenced in ASpace and included in the Collection file on H after being evaluated for accuracy. Inaccurate inventories can be filed in the case file separate from the Accession Record.
  - The extent of the collection and number of boxes after accessioning is completed.
  - The shelf location of boxes after accessioning.

- An ["Unprocessed Accession" sign](https://mycsun.box.com/s/cy19yoz1gzdhjzhychc7824varcsz92p) (internal link) should be affixed to each box.  The "Unprocessed Accession" sign includes the name of the collection, name of the donor, date of the addition, the name of the accessioning archivist, a brief description of contents, and the accession number.

- Sometimes new accessions contain materials that obviously should not be kept with the archival records.  (For example, a faculty member's personal papers may arrive with 10 boxes of books from the shelves in their office.)  When this is the case, the accessioner may immediately separate materials that are better handled separately from the manuscript or archival materials. The accessioner must record this action by completing the Deaccession fields in the ArchivesSpace Accession record. See the "Weeding, Discards, and Separations" section on the [Processing page](https://illuminatedpast.github.io/csun-sca-processing/02-processing/02-04-physicalprocessing.html) for additional instructions.

- The accessioning archivist creates a digital and a physical Case File, which combined with ASpace, will include documentation of actions undertaken by archivists with regards to a particular accession.  This includes Separation Records, donor-provided inventories, and any other relevant paperwork.  Additional documentation generated during processing, digitization, or other activities will be stored in these files in the future.

- Next the accessioning archivist places the collection boxes in AS/RS or on shelves, and adds the extent and box locations to ArchivesSpace. To load new boxes into AS/RS, the Archivist fills out the [AS/RS Load Inventory Form](https://mycsun.box.com/s/uf8c3kgcq7hpd5hn73us3weqy6siq3nf) (internal link) and sends the AS/RS Lead an e-mail to let them know that a new Non-LC (NLC) Load is coming down for storage. Once the boxes are loaded, the AS/RS Lead sends back the completed Load form, including the AS/RS bin number. The Archivist saves the completed AS/RS Load Inventory Form to the Collection folder on H.
