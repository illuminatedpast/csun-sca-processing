## Adding Accession Records to ArchivesSpace

Required fields are indicated by a bold field title. 

| Field       | Instructions |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Title** | Enter the Collection title.       |
| **Identifier** | The Identifier is comprised of four numbers, which should be entered in the four boxes available in Aspace: 4-digit year, 3-digit accession #, Repository code, Collection code     |
| **Accession Date** | The date the collection was deeded to CSUN (from the "Received by" signature line on the Deed of Gift). |
| **Content Description** | Enter the Abstract here <br> Include a short identification of the creator of the collection, a summary of the records, significant correspondents, and, in the case of organizational records, previous and subsequent names of the organization. For University Archives it is important to note all creating agencies on campus during the life of the records in custody. <br> When spawning a resource record this gets spun into a Scope and Contents note |
| **Condition Description** | Describe the physical condition of the materials including the following: <br> **Arrangement**: What is the current organizational scheme of materials in the accession? <br> **Description**: What is the level of description for these materials upon their arrival? <br> **Physical condition**: What physical condition are these materials in? |
| **Inventory** | A brief description of the contents of each box, including any information that is readily available or that the donor provided. Do not spend time searching for dates on individual documents to provide a date range. Include one if the donor supplied it only. Also include the type of box. Eg. Box 1, Record Carton, 1999-2009, Administrative papers and photographs. |
| **Provenance** | Use this field to indicate who the donor is and any other chain of custody information. |
| General Note | Add any additional information here. i.e. "An accrual of Digital Images is expected in the future", or “ |
| **Acquisition Type** | Choose between "Gift", "Purchase", or "Transfer" |
| **Resource Type** | Choose between "Collection", "Papers", "Publications", or "Records." Usually it is a "Collection." |
| **Publish** | The "Publish" checkbox should already be selected. |
| Access Restrictions | Enter if there are any |
| Use Restrictions | Enter if there are any |
| **Dates** | Enter Date(s) of Creation for the materials you are accessioning here using DACS Standards for an Inclusive Date, if you have it. |
| **Extents** | Enter the Extent of the accession |
| **Agent Links** | Enter the Collection Creator |
| Related Resources | Enter if there are any |
| Related Accessions | Enter if there are any |
| External Documents | Enter in any external documents that are relevant here (e.g. a donor-created inventory that is saved in the physical case file or in the collection directory on the H drive) |
| **Instances - Container Instance for a Physical Box** | Add an instance for each box. <br> The Type should be **"Accession"** and make sure to enter the **barcode** and a **location** |
| **Instances - Digital Objects** | Add a single Digital Object instance to represent all digital files. Follow [instructions for creating Digital Objects in ASpace](https://mycsun.app.box.com/file/1296297597333), with the exception of entering both the Digital Object Title and Identifier as the title of the digital accessions folder (Example: <em>UnprocessedAccession_2019-015</em>) |
| Deaccessions | These fields are only used when a Separation is done during accessioning. For instructions on how to use these fields, see the “Weeding, Discards, and Separations” section on the [Processing page](https://illuminatedpast.github.io/csun-sca-processing/02-processing/02-04-physicalprocessing.html). |
| **Collection Management** | Under "Processing Status" select "Unprocessed" if this is a new accession, or "In Processing" if you are currently processing this collection. <br> **Once an accession is processed, reopen the accession record and change the "processing status" field to "Processed"** |

Data in an Accession record can be spawned into additional Accession records to reflect a hierarchical or sibling relationship. It can also be spawned into a new Resource record. Edits to a spawned Resource record do not change the Accession record it came from. Only the first Accession record can be spawned to the Resource record; data from subsequent Accession records associated with the same resource will need to be entered manually.
