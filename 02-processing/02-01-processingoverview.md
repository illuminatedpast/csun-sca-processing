## Processing Overview

This guide outlines the manner in which basic archival principles are applied in Special Collections and Archives at California State University, Northridge. It assumes that its users have an understanding of contemporary archival principles and practices, and should be applied to processing work completed in all Special Collections and Archives areas, including Special Collections, the Urban Archives, International Guitar Research Archives, Old China Hands Archives, Tom & Ethel Bradley Center Collections, and University Archives.

Processing is the arrangement, description, and preservation of a collection. These three functions, often carried out concurrently, are necessary to establish administrative, intellectual, and physical control over SC/A holdings and to facilitate and promote research. Though guidelines have been established, flexibility is critical in these processes.

The record unit central to the arrangement and description process is ordinarily an archival collection or university archives record group. The basic record unit is used to appraise, acquire, accession, store and reference records. Finding aids describe archival materials at this level.

The processing archivist chooses the level of arrangement, description, and preservation given a collection by considering a number of factors. These include how well access is improved by a particular method of processing, the relative importance of the materials to the department's holdings, and the cost of labor and materials in consultation with the SC/A Librarian. 

Appropriate arrangement, description, and preservation are more important than uniform arrangement, description, and preservation. Historical value, anticipated use, physical condition, donor agreements, and expense of treatment options (in both time and money) should all be considered when choosing the level to which a collection should be processed.
