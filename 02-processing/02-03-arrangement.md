## Arrangement

Arrangement of collections includes all physical and intellectual actions made in a collection from its time of accessioning.

Special Collections and Archives follow the archival principles of provenance and original order. Compelling reasons must exist for imposing an organization other than original order except when no order is apparent.

Physical order does not need to reflect intellectual order, though convenience for reference service should be considered when boxing a collection (i.e., materials likely to be paged together should be kept together if possible.) Folder titles should be chosen and phrased to reflect the arrangement.   Organizing individual documents within the file unit is rarely done.
