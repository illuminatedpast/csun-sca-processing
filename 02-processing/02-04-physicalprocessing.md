## Physical Processing

### Non-Textual Records in Collections

The processing archivist addresses collections in the aggregate, describing non-textual records with the textual parts of all collections. Descriptions of these materials will be incorporated into the finding aid. Generally group description, similar to a folder or box level description, will be adequate.

It is important to identify the different types of media within a collection since they may have different treatment and storage requirements. (Retain original order when separating formats.)

The following are some examples of formats that may necessitate separate housing:

- Architectural drawings: originals and copies of drawings, plans, elevations, and renderings
- Ephemera
- Graphics, including original artwork and drawings, watercolors, and cartoons
- Photographic media, including albums, cased images, lantern slides, negatives, prints, slides, and stereographs
- Microfilm
- Digital files  

Albums should generally be disassembled during processing, but must be looked at on a case by case basis. The processing archivist should consult with the supervising archivist or librarian and staff as necessary prior to disassembling albums. If appropriate, albums should be paginated and photocopied or digitally copied prior to disassembly.

### Weeding, Discards, and Separations

The term "weeding" encompasses everything from reappraisal of entire series to discarding duplicates. To what level of detail weeding will be done depends on the amount of benefit (in additional clarity, space reduction, and preservation effort) to be gained compared to the amount of time required.

Sometimes it may be more efficient to leave unnecessary materials in the collection than to remove them. Student assistants can perform routine weeding, especially of duplicates, with very clear instructions given concerning the types of materials for discard.

Separations are materials that are peripheral or unimportant to an accession or collection. Separations are sent to other departments in the library, stay in Special Collections and Archives as separate and discrete entities, are returned to donors, or are discarded. It is critical that the details of the gift agreement be followed when arranging for the disposition of separations. The staff member in contact with the donor may be required to return unwanted materials to donors. If unwanted materials do not need to be returned to the donor, discards should be recycled or thrown away, as appropriate.

Publications are normally separated and cataloged for appropriate locations in the library, and are not considered part of the archival or manuscript collection. The catalogers in the library's Collection Access and Management Services Department create catalog records for Special Collections materials. Items are considered for this kind of separation when they have an author, title, publisher, publication date, and do not consist of photocopies.    Separated publications are added to the backlog shelves in Stacks along with a flag indicating the accession number and name of the collection from which it originated.

A Separation Form must be completed for discards and separations and saved to the case file on H. The Separation Form is in the folder at H:\SpecialCollectionsArchives\Forms\Separations. Duplicates do not need to be noted on a separation form, unless there is an extensive number of duplicates.

### Preservation
Special Collections and Archives performs basic preservation techniques in house, such as photocopying acidic originals or removing rusted fasteners. More complicated preservation needs may require vended services. All preservation decisions should be made with an eye to the collection as a whole, and in consultation between the processing archivist, SC/A Librarian, and other staff as necessary. Decisions regarding the migration of audiovisual materials should be made in consultation with Digital Services.

### Storage of Collections
- **Collections in Process**
Unprocessed collections are listed in the ArchivesSpace Accessions module. Generally, collections in process are temporarily stored near the processor's work area or in the designated storage area for collections in process. When collections are permanently removed from the stacks, or are temporarily moved to a different location for more than a week, the location for the container instances attached to the Accession record in ASpace must be updated. 
- **Finished Collections**
When processing is completed collections are stored in one of the Special Collections and Archives storage areas. Different parts of a collection can be stored in different locations. Stable 20th and 21st century paper collections are usually stored in AS/RS. Audiovisual materials, fragile paper, photographs, and very small collections may be stored in 4 or Stacks. Consult [digital processing documentation](https://illuminatedpast.github.io/csun-sca-processing/02-processing/02-05-digitalprocessing.html) for up-to-date information on where to store processed digital files.

### Administrative
When processing is completed the processing archivist returns to the ArchivesSpace Accession record and:
- Deletes related accession container instances
- Updates the Accession>Collection Management>Processing Status to read “Processed”
- Makes sure that the newly processed collection is listed as a “Related Resource” . This happens automatically if you spawned the resource from that accession, but if not, you must do it manually.

### Physical Processing Guidelines for Student Assistants

These general guidelines are intended for use by Student Assistants and should be adapted as needed for specific collections’ processing requirements:
Use the following supplies
- Discards box
- Folder template
- Pencil
- Plastic eraser
- Staple/fastener remover
- New acid-free folders
- PH pen
- Mylar strips
- Box marker

- Use new, clean acid-free folders for all final housing (see folder template). Don’t overstuff folders; avoid going over 2-3 crease lines when possible.
- Photocopy fragile originals, including all newsprint, onto acid-free bond paper. Remove the original from the collection and place it in your discards box (do not recycle anything before an archivist has seen it).
- Remove post-it or other sticky notes. If anything has been written upon the note, either transfer the message with a pencil in square brackets (for brief notes of one or two words), or photocopy the post-it onto acid-free paper. Place the photocopy in the collection in place of the post-it, and place and place the post-it in your discards box.
- Remove all duplicates from collections. If one copy has hand-written notes on it, keep that one with the collection and discard the rest. Otherwise, keep the copy in the best physical condition.
- If you find whole notebooks or legal pads in the collection, carefully detach the used pages either by hand or with a razor blade and keep ONLY those pages with the collection. If the entire pad has been used, remove any metal fasteners and detach the cardboard back.
- Remove paper clips, rubber bands, and string that attaches sheets of paper together. Staples should stay in place unless they are rusting. If sequencing is crucial, paginate using a soft pencil, marking the page number in brackets in the upper right-hand corner of the page.
- Remove material from original wrappers and binders whenever possible. If necessary, you may want to photocopy the original wrapper before placing it in your discards box. Some wrappers may have artifactual value and will be retained for exhibition.
- Remove letters from envelopes, unfold them, and put the envelope in front of the letter with which it belongs. Put empty envelopes in your discards box.
- Put photographs in Mylar sleeves. Use photo sheets when there are many photos, and place prints back to back in the sheets if the backs of the photos are blank. Use gloves when handling photographs.
- Flatten whatever folded items you can safely; flag others that are too fragile to flatten safely.
- If you supply or transfer a date, mark the date using pencil in brackets in the upper right hand corner of the page in this format: [1985 May 6].
- If you find any information about an individual of a personal nature, such as a social security or bank account number, flag that item. Addresses and phone numbers are fine.
- Leave oversized material in place, but mark it with a flag for Archivist review.
- Dates should appear as a range (1938-1943.) If dates are unknown and no circa date can be surmised, use “undated.” 
- Check the formatting of all dates so they are as follows:
YYYY
YYYY-YYYY
ca. yyyy
ca. yyyy-yyyy
ca. yyyy-ca. yyyy
If necessary to include month or day in the date, the date written on the folder should be formatted Year Month Day, example: 1979 April 17 (IMPORTANT: This is the date expression field in ArchivesSpace. For the machine readable fields in ArchivesSpace dates must go in using numbers formatted YYYY-MM-DD, example: 1979-04-17)
