### Physical Processing Guidelines for Student Assistants

These general guidelines are intended for use by Student Assistants and should be adapted as needed for specific collections’ processing requirements:
Use the following supplies
- Discards box
- Folder template
- Pencil
- Plastic eraser
- Staple/fastener remover
- New acid-free folders
- PH pen
- Mylar strips
- Box marker

- Use new, clean acid-free folders for all final housing (see folder template). Don’t overstuff folders; avoid going over 2-3 crease lines when possible.
- Photocopy fragile originals, including all newsprint, onto acid-free bond paper. Remove the original from the collection and place it in your discards box (do not recycle anything before an archivist has seen it).
- Remove post-it or other sticky notes. If anything has been written upon the note, either transfer the message with a pencil in square brackets (for brief notes of one or two words), or photocopy the post-it onto acid-free paper. Place the photocopy in the collection in place of the post-it, and place and place the post-it in your discards box.
- Remove all duplicates from collections. If one copy has hand-written notes on it, keep that one with the collection and discard the rest. Otherwise, keep the copy in the best physical condition.
- If you find whole notebooks or legal pads in the collection, carefully detach the used pages either by hand or with a razor blade and keep ONLY those pages with the collection. If the entire pad has been used, remove any metal fasteners and detach the cardboard back.
- Remove paper clips, rubber bands, and string that attaches sheets of paper together. Staples should stay in place unless they are rusting. If sequencing is crucial, paginate using a soft pencil, marking the page number in brackets in the upper right-hand corner of the page.
- Remove material from original wrappers and binders whenever possible. If necessary, you may want to photocopy the original wrapper before placing it in your discards box. Some wrappers may have artifactual value and will be retained for exhibition.
- Remove letters from envelopes, unfold them, and put the envelope in front of the letter with which it belongs. Put empty envelopes in your discards box.
- Put photographs in Mylar sleeves. Use photo sheets when there are many photos, and place prints back to back in the sheets if the backs of the photos are blank. Use gloves when handling photographs.
- Flatten whatever folded items you can safely; flag others that are too fragile to flatten safely.
- If you supply or transfer a date, mark the date using pencil in brackets in the upper right hand corner of the page in this format: [1985 May 6].
- If you find any information about an individual of a personal nature, such as a social security or bank account number, flag that item. Addresses and phone numbers are fine.
- Leave oversized material in place, but mark it with a flag for Archivist review.
- Dates should appear as a range (1938-1943.) If dates are unknown and no circa date can be surmised, use “undated.” 
- Check the formatting of all dates so they are as follows:
YYYY
YYYY-YYYY
ca. yyyy
ca. yyyy-yyyy
ca. yyyy-ca. yyyy
If necessary to include month or day in the date, the date written on the folder should be formatted Year Month Day, example: 1979 April 17 (IMPORTANT: This is the date expression field in ArchivesSpace. For the machine readable fields in ArchivesSpace dates must go in using numbers formatted YYYY-MM-DD, example: 1979-04-17)
