## Digital Processing

The following instructions are not intended for born-digital collections with complex original order or large digital collections requiring more intensive preservation measures. These policies and procedures will be updated when we implement Preservica. This guide is intended primarily for processing collections from:
- Scan and return projects
  - Example: Old China Hands digital-only photo collections
- Artificially created collections
  - Examples: COVID-19 Community Archives, Oral History Project Collections
- Small, simple digital collections
- Physical collections with a small number of digital objects and/or simple digital objects in accessible file formats (often migrated from physical media – floppies, CDs, cassette tapes, etc.) that don’t have extensive digital original order.
  - Examples: CDs, floppies, and USBs pulled from physical folders in primarily physical collections like APACC and CRC5
 
### Accessioning

#### Files are digital and not on physical media. No concern about file date/time stamps: 
1.	Direct donor to Box location to upload files. Box will perform a virus check upon upload.     
2.	Create an unprocessed accession folder with the accession number in the appropriate Collection Folder on X:
a.	Example: Unprocessed Accession 23-04
3.	Transfer files from Box location to unprocessed accession folder on Z
4.	Accession files as you would a physical collection.

#### Files need to be migrated off physical media:
1.	Create an unprocessed accession folder with the accession number in the appropriate Collection Folder on X:
a.	Example: Unprocessed Accession 23-04
2.	Capture any relevant data from the physical media (see: Procedures for Imaging Audio-Visual Materials document in H:\SpecialCollectionsArchives\Policies and Procedures\Processing)
3.	Migrate digital files off physical media
a.	Archivist: CDs, 3 ¼” floppies, USB drives, hard drives with straightforward files, and other simple physical media QUESTION: Have a dedicated, isolated computer in the workroom or 314 that the Archivists can use (with write-blocker, virus software, ability to generate file directories for accession box lists, disconnected from internet/networks)?    
b.	And/or Digital Services Librarian: Hard drives with PII and challenging file formats, Zip drives, VHS tapes, cassette tapes, records, other selected A/V media, 8mm/16mm   
c.	And/or External vendor: 35mm/other film formats, large quantities of VHS/cassette tapes (paid for by specific collection funds or new funding requests to the Dean)
4.	Transfer migrated files to the appropriate Unprocessed Accession folde  r on Z.
5.	If transfer of files is successful, dispose of physical media. If there are concerns, retain physical media in the accession. 
6.	Additional physical media may be discovered later during processing. This is ok.
7.	Accession files as you would a physical collection.

### Processing

The same basic processing principles apply to digital documents as if you were processing a physical collection.

#### Processing Plan:
Describe in the processing plan how detailed the description will be for digital files. Will you describe all the digital files in a single Digital Object? Will the digital files need to be arranged in digital folders? Are there PII or restriction concerns that will impact processing needs? Will file formats need to be migrated to more accessible or long-term preservation formats?  

#### Arrangement:
1.	Create a folder on the Z drive labeled “COLLECTIONCODE Digital Files”
2.	Example: MUE Digital Files 
3.	Move a copy of the files from the Unprocessed Accession folder into the Digital Files folder. This is your working files folder. Do not modify the files in the Unprocessed Accession folder.
4.	If part of processing plan, arrange the digital items into digital folders labeled "COLLECTIONCODE_[Series if applicable]_FolderTitle_Date"
a.	Example: MEA_I_ConservativeIllusionCorrespondence_1983
b.	Treat CDs and floppies pulled from physical folders as you would a pulled oversized item. Use the same folder title for the digital object to link it to the folder it was removed from.
c.	Abbreviate folder titles as needed to keep file names short. Expand and spell out folder titles when they are entered into ASpace.   
5.	Do not rename individual files.
6.	Create a “Weeds” folder for duplicates and unnecessary files, and create a separation record as you would with a physical collection. 
7.	Resist the urge to arrange bigger collections at item level, unless there are PII or other restriction concerns. 

#### Processing:
1.	Convert files to accessible and/or long-term preservation formats as needed
a.	For common recommended accessible file formats, reference the University Library Digital Collections Technical Reference Guide - Digitization located here: W:\a_Admin\Workflows
b.	Within your Digital Files folder, create a Preservation folder and an Access folder. The file trees should match in each folder.
c.	Place original file formats in the Preservation folder and accessible file formats in the Access folder. 
2.	Identify and redact PII  
a.	Place unredacted originals in the Preservation folder.
b.	Place redacted copies in the Access folder.
3.	When relevant, separate any restricted files from unrestricted files in your Digital Files folder to ease the pick from shelf copying of folders onto the reading room hard drive:
i.	Open for Research 
ii.	On Campus Use ONLY
iii.	Restricted until YYYY
4.	Enter folder titles into ASpace. For hybrid physical and digital collections, insert digital folders into the container list following the collection/series arrangement. For example, alphabetical by folder title (see ASpace documentation for more detailed Digital Object data entry instructions):

5.	When processing is complete:
a.	Move any Preservation folders to Glacier  
b.	Retain Access folder in the Digital Files on Z
c.	Delete Weeds folder
d.	Delete Unprocessed Accession folder unless there is a compelling reason to retain files for future migration or other needs
