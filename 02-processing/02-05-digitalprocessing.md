## Digital Processing

Digital processing follows the same principles as physical processing. We use [Preservica](https://us.preservica.com/auth/login/?redirect=/sdb/dashboard.html) to preserve and steward processed digital collections. Unprocessed digital collections are store on the X drive until processing. Archival collections are arranged and described on the X drive before they are ingested into Preservica. Consider Preservica the final step of processing, equivalent to placing a physical box on a physical shelf.

### Accessioning

#### Files are digital and not on physical media. No concern about file date/time stamps: 
1.	Direct donor to a location on Box to upload files. Box will perform a virus check upon upload.     
2.	Create an unprocessed accession folder with the accession number in the appropriate Collection Folder on X. *Example: APACC_Unprocessed* and within that folder, add an accession folder, *Example: APACC_UnprocessedAccession_2023-002*.
3.	Transfer files from Box location to unprocessed accession folder on X.
4.	Accession files as you would a physical collection.

#### Files need to be migrated off physical media:
- If it doesn't already exist, create an unprocessed accession folder with the accession number in the appropriate Collection Folder on X. *Example: APACC_Unprocessed* and within that folder, add an accession folder, *Example: APACC_UnprocessedAccession_2023-002*.
-  Complete the [Digitization Request Spreadsheet](https://mycsun.box.com/s/v729j6sw39sv8050j9f15ayo0bivimdh) (internal link) for Digital Services.
-  Create a card on Digital Services' [Migration Requests Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/bWq1CFak/migration-requests) (internal link) in the "Request" Column. When Digital Services migrates data, they will capture container images. Note that 35mm and other film formats, and large quantities of VHS/cassette tapes may require external vendors. Work with Head of Special Collections on a case by case basis to determine funding availability for external vendor needs.
-  Place physical media on the Digital Services Request shelves in Stacks. Digital Services will contact the relevant archivist if they have questions and will send notification when the work is completed.
-  Digital Services will transfer migrated files to the appropriate unprocessed accession folder on X and return the physical media carriers to the Digital Services Request shelves in Stacks.
- Note migration of Digital Files by Digital Services and/or external vendor by adding an [Event to ArchivesSpace](https://mycsun.box.com/s/tzfqve0l4fztvsbbwz3uqbma0uc9ync2) (internal link).
- If transfer of files is successful, dispose of physical media. If there are concerns, retain physical media in the accession.
-  Additional physical media may be discovered later during processing. This is ok.
-  Accession files as you would a physical collection.

### Processing

The same basic processing principles apply to digital documents as if you were processing a physical collection.

#### Processing Plan:
Describe in the processing plan how detailed the description will be for digital files. Will you describe all the digital files in a single Digital Object? Will the digital files need to be arranged in digital folders? Are there PII or restriction concerns that will impact processing needs?

#### Arrangement:
1.	Create a folder on the X drive labeled “COLLECTIONCODE Digital Files” *Example: MUE Digital Files* 
2.	Move a copy of the files from the Unprocessed Accession folder into the Digital Files folder. This is your working files folder. Do not modify the files in the Unprocessed Accession folder.
3.	If the collection processing plan includes folder-level arrangement and file renaming, arrange the digital items into digital folders labeled "COLLECTIONCODE_[Series if applicable]_FolderTitle_Date" *Example: MEA_I_ConservativeIllusionCorrespondence_1983*
4.	Treat CDs and floppies pulled from physical folders as you would a pulled oversized item. Use the same folder title for the digital object to link it to the folder it was removed from.
5.	Abbreviate folder titles as needed to keep file names short. Expand and spell out folder titles when they are entered into ASpace.
6.	Do not rename individual files.
7.	Create a “Weeds” folder for duplicates and unnecessary files, and create a separation record as you would with a physical collection.
8.	Resist the urge to arrange bigger collections at item level, unless there are PII or other restriction concerns. 

#### Digital Processing:
1.	When relevant, separate any restricted files from unrestricted files in your Digital Files folder. As needed, create folders labeled:
- Open for Research
- On Campus Use ONLY
- Restricted until YYYY
2. 	Preservica is unable to identify and redact PII. This should be done before ingesting files into Preservica. If files will be permanently redacted, delete the originals. If original files will eventually be opened, place in approriate restricted folder.
3.  Preservica will create access copies and convert files to accessible and/or long-term preservation formats as needed.
4.  Preservica will run checksums. No need to do this before ingest, or to ingest checksum files into Preservica.
5. 	Enter folder titles into ASpace. For hybrid physical and digital collections, insert digital folders into the container list following the collection/series arrangement. For example, alphabetical by folder title (see ASpace documentation for more detailed Digital Object data entry instructions).
6. Ingest processed collection folder into Preservica. PLACE LINK TO PRESERVICA HOW TO INGEST INSTRUCTIONS HERE
7.	When Preservica ingest is complete, delete all collection folders from X. X is only a holding space for unprocessed collections and a workspace for arrangement and processing.
