## Reparative Description

Intro text with link to Reparative Description Working Group Inclusive Description Guidelines (internal). 

### Recording Changes in the Finding Aid 

Before a finding aid revision is added to the Online Archive of California, save a PDF of the unrevised finding aid to the collection’s digital case file. 

### Finding Aid Revision Fields

Use Revision Statement (internal facing) and Processing Information (external facing) to note reparative description work. See [Description & Finding Aids page](https://illuminatedpast.github.io/csun-sca-processing/02-processing/02-06-description/02-06-description.html) for more details on what to include. These notes are generally applied at the Collection level only.

### Content Warnings

Content warnings may be added to multiple level of the finding aid, in a collection-level or folder-level scope and contents note, as well as on physical folders. For instructions on labeling physical folders, see [Folder Template on the Physical Processing page](https://illuminatedpast.github.io/csun-sca-processing/02-processing/02-04-physicalprocessing.html).

If disclaimers are needed in a majority of folders in a box, it’s ok to forego adding notes to every folder in the finding aid in favor of description in the collection-level scope and contents note. Make sure to indicate the extent and location of challenging material in the collection.
