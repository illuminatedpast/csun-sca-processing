## Reparative Description

Intro text with link to Reparative Description Working Group Inclusive Description Guidelines (internal). 

### Finding Aid Revision Fields

Use Revision Statement (internal facing) and Processing Information (external facing) to note reparative description work. See [Description & Finding Aids page](https://illuminatedpast.github.io/csun-sca-processing/02-processing/02-06-description/02-06-description.html) for more details on what to include. These notes are generally applied at the Collection level only.

### Content Warnings

Content warnings may be added to multiple parts of the finding aid, such as the scope and contents??, folder level notes, as well as on physical folders. If disclaimers are needed in a majority of folders in a box, it’s ok to forego adding notes to every folder in the finding aid in favor of description in the collection-level scope and contents note, indicating the extent and location of challenging material in the collection.

### Recording Changes in the Finding Aid 

Before a finding aid revision is added to the Online Archive of California, save a PDF of the unrevised finding aid to the collection’s digital case file.
