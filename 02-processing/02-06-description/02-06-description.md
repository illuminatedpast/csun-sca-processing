## Description & Finding Aids

Some elements should be used in all finding aids, while others are optional, and should be used only where necessary to enhance patrons' ability to understand and use the collection. Mandatory elements are marked *Required*. Finding aids may include the following elements (additional [DACS fields](https://saa-ts-dacs.github.io/) may be used after consultation with the SC/A Librarian or Head):

## Finding Aid Front Matter Elements

### Basic Information

#### Title *REQUIRED*
The full collection name (with abbreviations in parentheses) must be included.

#### Identifier *REQUIRED*
The unique identifier assigned to the collection, used for cataloging and paging. The assigned collection code letters can be reflective of the collection (for example, the Fred M.

### Notes
     
#### Immediate Source of Acquisition   
This section includes the name(s) of the collection's donor(s), if known, as well as when the donation(s) were made. This should be formatted as [Donor Name], [YYYY]. If the collection came in multiple years, add the subsequent relevant dates using commas to separate them.

#### Conditions Governing Access *REQUIRED*
The terms, conditions, and length of any restrictions must be included in the finding guide for each collection.

#### Conditions Governing Use *REQUIRED*
Use the department’s copyright statement::\SpecialCollectionsArchives\Administrative\Copyright statements\CSUN Copyright Statements.docx  

#### Processing Information *REQUIRED*   
Include all processing archivist names as well as the year when processing was finished. Student Assistants may be included at the discretion of the processing archivist.

#### Accruals   
Note here any additional anticipated donations, as appropriate. This field is primarily relevant for record groups that have record retention schedules.

#### Preferred Citation *REQUIRED*
Use the department's citation statement:
For information about citing items in this collection consult the appropriate style manual, or see the [Citing Archival Materials](https://libguides.csun.edu/citing-archives) guide.   

#### Abstract *REQUIRED*
Abstracts should include date spans, a brief identification and description of the collection's creator, a summary of the content of the records, significant correspondents, and (in the case of organizational records), previous and subsequent names of the organization. For University Archives materials, it is important to note all the creating agencies involved in the life of the records being described. 

#### Administrative/Biographical History   
In a few brief, succinct paragraphs, this section of the finding aid places the records in context. It should briefly outline the life of the individual or organization responsible for creating the records. Occasionally it will outline the history of the records by describing its function through its life. It should also highlight historical information pertinent to the records. Avoid unnecessary detail, information readily available elsewhere, and information which is common knowledge. Remember your purpose is to place the records in context, not to write definitive histories or biographies.

Administrative Histories generally begin with information about the initial organization or incorporation of the records creator, including when, where, why, under what conditions, under whose auspices, under authority of what statutes, charter or bylaws, etc. They briefly describe immediate antecedents; early history; and changes in name, mission, functions, and organization. Discuss important or key figures, describe current or most recent activities, and describe the conditions leading to the organization's disbanding if it no longer exists.

Biographies generally begin with information about an individuals' birth, including when, where, and to whom. They include brief genealogical and family background data, if available, as well as information about education, early career, marriage and family. Focus on activities documented by the papers, including relationships to important figures and with organizations. End with a note on current activities or with a note on the date, place, and circumstances of death. Do not include information that will quickly become outdated.  

#### Scope and Content Note *REQUIRED*   
The purpose of this section is to provide information in narrative form about the records unit as a whole. It should consist of an introductory paragraph, which describes the emphasis or focus of the records in terms of subject matter, geographic areas and dates emphasized and types of records. Weaknesses or gaps in the documentation as well as strengths and potential research possibilities might also be mentioned. See [Anatomy of a Scope Note](https://mycsun.box.com/s/30yltrazxe6ysy73b39hgmdgnmnspd6m) (internal link) for additional guidance.

Any series  included in the collection are explicitly listed. Other paragraphs that describe the content of individual series or subseries follow. These descriptions serve little purpose if they merely repeat the container list in narrative form; they should describe and analyze the content and substance of the records. Refer to recent finding aids for examples.

Each series should receive at least one paragraph of description, with the series title appearing boldfaced within the text.     
*Example: The Correspondence consists of . . .*

#### Arrangement  of Materials   
This section is used when collections contain Series. It should include a simple outline of the collection’s organization, showing major series and all subseries, with dates.

> *Example:   
> Series I: Correspondence, 1920-1923   
>     Subseries A: 1920-1921   
>     Subseries B: 1922-1923   
> Series II: Meeting Minutes, 1912-1950   
> Series III: Photographs, 1910-1975   
>     Subseries A: Parker Family, 1910-1952   
>     Subseries B: Davis Family, 1950-1954*

The Series and Subseries entered into ArchivesSpace require linebreaks in order to format properly for display on the Online Archive of California.To indent a Subseries, place 4 spaces in front of the Subseries title's <p>. *Example:*

```

<p>Series I: Business, Social, Religious, and Educational Groups, 1951-1989</p>
<p>Series II: Events and Places, 1952-1988</p>
<p>Series III: People, 1955-1989</p>
<p>Series IV: Products, Non-Human Subjects, and Working Papers and Tests, 1950-1978</p>


```

#### Existence and Location of Copies   
This field can be used to direct users to any digital surrogates that might be available in the library's digital collections or elsewhere. 
 
#### Related Materials   
This section alerts the researcher to closely related materials within our collections and/or held at other institutions   if they are particularly closely related to the collection (for example, they share provenance). Avoid citing peripheral materials of only possible interest.

---

### Instances     
The box list embodies the most detailed level of access we provide. It should supply as much detail as is appropriate to the nature of the collection. The majority of collections here are described to the folder level. Extremely detailed description, because it requires an infinite amount of time and clutters the box list, is as bad as too little description. Headings should be meaningful, reflecting the content of the material. Folder and item level notes fields are rarely used, but may be included as appropriate for Conditions Governing Access restrictions and/or for Scope and Content.

---

### Review and Distribution Procedures for Finding Aids
The Special Collections and Archives Librarian or Head of Special Collections and Archives receives the final versions of all finding aids, and checks them for consistency and accuracy with an eye to researcher access. After making any necessary revisions, the SC/A Librarian sends the finding aid to cataloging for addition to the Online Archive of California and the Library catalog.
