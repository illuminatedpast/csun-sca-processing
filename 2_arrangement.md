# Arrangement
Arrangement of collections includes all physical and intellectual actions made in a collection from its time of accessioning.

## 1. Accession Records:
Upon arrival in the Special Collections and Archives unit, all collections are accessioned into our existing holdings. As part of this process new accessions are carefully inspected for insects and mold, and are re-boxed, if necessary. An "Unprocessed Donation" label is attached to the side of each box, which includes the name of the collection, name of the donor, date of the accession, the name of the staff person accessioning the donation, and a brief description of the box's contents.

An Accession Record is created, which includes a brief abstract describing the collection's creator(s), its contents, and any particular strengths. A brief inventory of the collection's contents is also taken at this time. The name of the collection, a description of it, and the location are entered into the Master Shelf List. See Accessioning Policies and Procedures for more information.  

## 2. Processing Plans:
After a collection has been selected for processing, background materials from department case files are gathered, preliminary historical research is performed, the collection is surveyed, and a processing plan is prepared. During this planning stage, the archivist consults with other staff members as needed, especially the SC/A Librarian who approves all processing plans. 

For collections lacking original order, archivists should avoid imposing complex series structure with many small series and subseries. Older finding aids in SC/A may contain complex imposed series structure, but this practice is no longer done.

Plans and their revisions are kept on the H drive, and remain there after processing is completed. Archivists may place additional relevant processing notes and documents on the H drive and in the physical case file as appropriate. Processing plans are working documents, and can vary in length and formality. Major processing plan revisions need to be reviewed by the Special Collections and Archives Librarian or Head of Special Collections and Archives.      

Processing plans serve to:
- Track decisions made, especially for future archivists
- Provide a starting point for discussing processing levels and techniques among staff
- Ensure the initiation of communication between staff in the Special Collections and Archives unit
- Aid in the setting of goals and objectives by the Head of Special Collections and Archives and  unit staff
- Notify staff of any special supplies or materials that will be needed to complete processing 

Processing plans are internal documents only. There is a template available on the H drive at H:\SpecialCollectionsArchives\Policies and Procedures\Processing. 

## 3. Physical Processing:   
Special Collections and Archives follow the archival principles of provenance and original order. Compelling reasons must exist for imposing an organization other than original order except when no order is apparent.

Physical order does not need to reflect intellectual order, though convenience for reference service should be considered when boxing a collection (i.e., materials likely to be paged together should be kept together if possible.) Folder titles should be chosen and phrased to reflect the arrangement.   Organizing individual documents within the file unit is rarely done.

a. Non-Textual Records in Collections:
The processing archivist addresses collections in the aggregate, describing non-textual records with the textual parts of all collections. Descriptions of these materials will be incorporated into the finding aid. Generally group description, similar to a folder or box level description, will be adequate.

It is important to identify the different types of media within a collection since they may have different treatment and storage requirements. (Retain original order when separating formats.)

The following are some examples of formats that may necessitate separate housing:

·	Architectural drawings: originals and copies of drawings, plans, elevations, and renderings
·	Ephemera
·	Graphics, including original artwork and drawings, watercolors, and cartoons
·	Photographic media, including albums, cased images, lantern slides, negatives, prints, slides, and stereographs
·	Posters or other oversized materials
·	Microfilm
·	Digital files  

Albums should generally be disassembled during processing, but must be looked at on a case by case basis. The processing archivist should consult with the supervising archivist or librarian and staff as necessary prior to disassembling albums. If appropriate, albums should be paginated and photocopied or digitally copied prior to disassembly.  

b. Weeding, Discards, and Separations:
The term "weeding" encompasses everything from reappraisal of entire series to discarding duplicates. To what level of detail weeding will be done depends on the amount of benefit (in additional clarity, space reduction, and preservation effort) to be gained compared to the amount of time required.

Sometimes it may be more efficient to leave unnecessary materials in the collection than to remove them. Student assistants can perform routine weeding, especially of duplicates, with very clear instructions given concerning the types of materials for discard.

Separations are materials that are peripheral or unimportant to an accession or collection. Separations are sent to other departments in the library, stay in Special Collections and Archives as separate and discrete entities, are returned to donors, or are discarded. It is critical that the details of the gift agreement be followed when arranging for the disposition of separations. The staff member in contact with the donor may be required to return unwanted materials to donors. If unwanted materials do not need to be returned to the donor, discards should be recycled or thrown away, as appropriate.

Publications are normally separated and cataloged for appropriate locations in the library, and are not considered part of the archival or manuscript collection. The catalogers in the library's Collection Access and Management Services Department create catalog records for Special Collections materials. Items are considered for this kind of separation when they have an author, title, publisher, publication date, and do not consist of photocopies.    Separated publications are added to the backlog shelves in Stacks along with a flag indicating the accession number and name of the collection from which it originated.

A Separation Form must be completed for discards and separations and saved to the case file on H. The Separation Form is in the folder at H:\SpecialCollectionsArchives\Forms\Separations. Duplicates do not need to be noted on a separation form, unless there is an extensive number of duplicates.

c. Preservation:  
Special Collections and Archives performs basic preservation techniques in house, such as photocopying acidic originals or removing rusted fasteners. More complicated preservation needs may require vended services. All preservation decisions should be made with an eye to the collection as a whole, and in consultation between the processing archivist, SC/A Librarian, and other staff as necessary. Decisions regarding the migration of audiovisual materials should be made in consultation with Digital Services.

d. Storage of Collections:
i. Collections in Process
Unprocessed collections are listed in the Master Shelf List. Generally, collections in process are temporarily stored near the processor's work area or in the designated storage area for collections in process. When collections are permanently removed from the stacks or are temporarily moved to a different location for more than a week, the Master Shelf List must be updated.

	ii. Locations for Finished Collections
When processing is completed collections are stored in one of the Special Collections and Archives storage areas. Different parts of a collection can be stored in different locations. Stable 20th and 21st century paper collections are usually stored in AS/RS. Audiovisual materials, fragile paper, photographs, and very small collections may be stored in Room 4 or Stacks.      Consult digital processing documentation for up-to-date information on where to store processed digital files.
