# Arrangement
Arrangement of collections includes all physical and intellectual actions made in a collection from its time of accessioning.

## 1. Accession Records:
Upon arrival in the Special Collections and Archives unit, all collections are accessioned into our existing holdings. As part of this process new accessions are carefully inspected for insects and mold, and are re-boxed, if necessary. An "Unprocessed Donation" label is attached to the side of each box, which includes the name of the collection, name of the donor, date of the accession, the name of the staff person accessioning the donation, and a brief description of the box's contents.

An Accession Record is created, which includes a brief abstract describing the collection's creator(s), its contents, and any particular strengths. A brief inventory of the collection's contents is also taken at this time. The name of the collection, a description of it, and the location are entered into the Master Shelf List. See Accessioning Policies and Procedures for more information.
