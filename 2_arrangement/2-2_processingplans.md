## 2. Processing Plans:
After a collection has been selected for processing, background materials from department case files are gathered, preliminary historical research is performed, the collection is surveyed, and a processing plan is prepared. During this planning stage, the archivist consults with other staff members as needed, especially the SC/A Librarian who approves all processing plans. 

For collections lacking original order, archivists should avoid imposing complex series structure with many small series and subseries. Older finding aids in SC/A may contain complex imposed series structure, but this practice is no longer done.

Plans and their revisions are kept on the H drive, and remain there after processing is completed. Archivists may place additional relevant processing notes and documents on the H drive and in the physical case file as appropriate. Processing plans are working documents, and can vary in length and formality. Major processing plan revisions need to be reviewed by the Special Collections and Archives Librarian or Head of Special Collections and Archives.      

Processing plans serve to:
- Track decisions made, especially for future archivists
- Provide a starting point for discussing processing levels and techniques among staff
- Ensure the initiation of communication between staff in the Special Collections and Archives unit
- Aid in the setting of goals and objectives by the Head of Special Collections and Archives and  unit staff
- Notify staff of any special supplies or materials that will be needed to complete processing 

Processing plans are internal documents only. There is a template available on the H drive.
