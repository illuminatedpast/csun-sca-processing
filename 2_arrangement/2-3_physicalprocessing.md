## 3. Physical Processing:   
Special Collections and Archives follow the archival principles of provenance and original order. Compelling reasons must exist for imposing an organization other than original order except when no order is apparent.

Physical order does not need to reflect intellectual order, though convenience for reference service should be considered when boxing a collection (i.e., materials likely to be paged together should be kept together if possible.) Folder titles should be chosen and phrased to reflect the arrangement.   Organizing individual documents within the file unit is rarely done.

a. Non-Textual Records in Collections:
The processing archivist addresses collections in the aggregate, describing non-textual records with the textual parts of all collections. Descriptions of these materials will be incorporated into the finding aid. Generally group description, similar to a folder or box level description, will be adequate.

It is important to identify the different types of media within a collection since they may have different treatment and storage requirements. (Retain original order when separating formats.)

The following are some examples of formats that may necessitate separate housing:
- Architectural drawings: originals and copies of drawings, plans, elevations, and renderings
- Ephemera
- Graphics, including original artwork and drawings, watercolors, and cartoons
- Photographic media, including albums, cased images, lantern slides, negatives, prints, slides, and stereographs
- Posters or other oversized materials
- Microfilm
- Digital files  

Albums should generally be disassembled during processing, but must be looked at on a case by case basis. The processing archivist should consult with the supervising archivist or librarian and staff as necessary prior to disassembling albums. If appropriate, albums should be paginated and photocopied or digitally copied prior to disassembly.  

b. Weeding, Discards, and Separations:
The term "weeding" encompasses everything from reappraisal of entire series to discarding duplicates. To what level of detail weeding will be done depends on the amount of benefit (in additional clarity, space reduction, and preservation effort) to be gained compared to the amount of time required.

Sometimes it may be more efficient to leave unnecessary materials in the collection than to remove them. Student assistants can perform routine weeding, especially of duplicates, with very clear instructions given concerning the types of materials for discard.

Separations are materials that are peripheral or unimportant to an accession or collection. Separations are sent to other departments in the library, stay in Special Collections and Archives as separate and discrete entities, are returned to donors, or are discarded. It is critical that the details of the gift agreement be followed when arranging for the disposition of separations. The staff member in contact with the donor may be required to return unwanted materials to donors. If unwanted materials do not need to be returned to the donor, discards should be recycled or thrown away, as appropriate.

Publications are normally separated and cataloged for appropriate locations in the library, and are not considered part of the archival or manuscript collection. The catalogers in the library's Collection Access and Management Services Department create catalog records for Special Collections materials. Items are considered for this kind of separation when they have an author, title, publisher, publication date, and do not consist of photocopies.    Separated publications are added to the backlog shelves in Stacks along with a flag indicating the accession number and name of the collection from which it originated.

A Separation Form must be completed for discards and separations and saved to the case file on H. The Separation Form is in the folder at H:\SpecialCollectionsArchives\Forms\Separations. Duplicates do not need to be noted on a separation form, unless there is an extensive number of duplicates.

c. Preservation:  
Special Collections and Archives performs basic preservation techniques in house, such as photocopying acidic originals or removing rusted fasteners. More complicated preservation needs may require vended services. All preservation decisions should be made with an eye to the collection as a whole, and in consultation between the processing archivist, SC/A Librarian, and other staff as necessary. Decisions regarding the migration of audiovisual materials should be made in consultation with Digital Services.

d. Storage of Collections:
-Collections in Process
--Unprocessed collections are listed in the Master Shelf List. Generally, collections in process are temporarily stored near the processor's work area or in the designated storage area for collections in process. When collections are permanently removed from the stacks or are temporarily moved to a different location for more than a week, the Master Shelf List must be updated.
-Locations for Finished Collections
--When processing is completed collections are stored in one of the Special Collections and Archives storage areas. Different parts of a collection can be stored in different locations. Stable 20th and 21st century paper collections are usually stored in AS/RS. Audiovisual materials, fragile paper, photographs, and very small collections may be stored in Room 4 or Stacks.      Consult digital processing documentation for up-to-date information on where to store processed digital files.
